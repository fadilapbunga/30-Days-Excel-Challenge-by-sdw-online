## Identification Database
There is a dataset from a university's admin team and we were asked to help them assess student progress by applying logical formulas. The dataset is at 'Student Performance' sheet. It contains Student ID,	Name,	Course,	Attendance (%),	Test Score,	Final Exam Score,	Pass Status,	Grade Category, and	Intervention Flag. Like the picture below:

## Identification Issues
There are 3 tasks that must be completed.

‚úÖ Task 1 ‚Äì Determine Pass Status

‚úÖ Task 2 ‚Äì Assign Grade Category
Use the IFS function with these rules:
- Score >= 85 ‚Üí 'Distinction'
- Score >= 60 ‚Üí 'Pass'
- Score < 60 ‚Üí 'Fail'

‚úÖ Task 3 ‚Äì Flag Students Needing Intervention
Use IF with AND/OR:
Flag students as needing intervention if:
- Attendance is less than 75% OR Final Exam Score is less than 50


üìå BONUS:
1. Use Conditional Formatting on 'Intervention Flag':
   - Red Fill for 'Needs Intervention'
   - Green Fill for 'OK'
2. Sort the dataset so that flagged students appear at the top
