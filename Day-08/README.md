## Identification Database
There is a dataset from a university's admin team and we were asked to help them assess student progress by applying logical formulas. The dataset is at 'Student Performance' sheet. It contains Student ID,	Name,	Course,	Attendance (%),	Test Score,	Final Exam Score,	Pass Status,	Grade Category, and	Intervention Flag. Like the picture below:

## Identification Issues
There are 3 tasks that must be completed.

‚úÖ Task 1 ‚Äì Determine Pass Status

‚úÖ Task 2 ‚Äì Assign Grade Category
Use the IFS function with these rules:
- Score >= 85 ‚Üí 'Distinction'
- Score >= 60 ‚Üí 'Pass'
- Score < 60 ‚Üí 'Fail'

‚úÖ Task 3 ‚Äì Flag Students Needing Intervention
Use IF with AND/OR:
Flag students as needing intervention if:
- Attendance is less than 75% OR Final Exam Score is less than 50


üìå BONUS:
1. Use Conditional Formatting on 'Intervention Flag':
   - Red Fill for 'Needs Intervention'
   - Green Fill for 'OK'
2. Sort the dataset so that flagged students appear at the top

## Solving Step or Analysis
‚úÖ Task 1

To determine pass status, there are two conditions, namely ‚Äòpass‚Äô or ‚Äòfail‚Äô, with the condition that if the final exam score is greater than or equal to 50, then the pass status is pass, and if it does not meet this condition, then the status is fail. We write the formula as below:

````excel
		=IF($F2>=50;"Pass";"Fail")
 ````

‚úÖ Task 2

To assign 'Grade Category', there are three conditions: ‚Äòdistinction‚Äô for a final exam score of 85 or higher, ‚Äòpass‚Äô for a final exam score of 60 or higher, and ‚Äòfail‚Äô for a final exam score of less than 60. Here, I am trying to use nested IF formulas, not IFS. Both can be used and will produce the same output. Both formulas can be broken down as follows:

````excel
		=IF($F2>=85;"Distinction";IF($F2>=60;"Pass";"Fail"))
 ````
or

````excel
		=IFS($F2>=85;"Distinction";$F2>=60;"Pass";$F2<60;"Fail")
 ````

‚úÖ Task 3

For task 3, there are several conditions that require the use of two functions in one command. The functions used are IF and OR. If both conditions are met, then Intervention is needed, and vice versa.

````excel
		=IF(OR($D2<75%;$F2<50);"Needs Intervention";"OK")
 ````

üìå BONUS:
1. Use conditional formatting with two rules, namely equal to, then change the fill color according to the command.

2. And for this sort, use a custom sort based on cell color. We want to know that the top row only contains students who need intervention, so change the custom sort to red cells and place them on top. .
