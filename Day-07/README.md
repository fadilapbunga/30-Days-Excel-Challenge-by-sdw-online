## Identification Database
To practice Week 1, there is a sheet with some variety column that contain data like: Department, Category, Month, Planned Budget (USD), Actual Spend (USD), and Notes. Like the picture below. And this sheet contains 500 rows.

## Identification Issues
Based on the instruction, we were asked to track which departments are spending wisely and which are going over budget.

## Solving Step or Analysis
1. Create new column and give it named 'Budget Status' and then fill in the following formula:
  ````excel
		=IF($E2<=$D2;"On Budget";"Over Budget")
 ````
if the actual spend is more than planned budget, it's over budget and vice versa.

2. Create pivot table with range the table and fill in the field pivot table with 'Department' into Rows and 'Planned Budget' & 'Actual Spend' into Values.

3. To see a rough visualization of the planned budget and actual spend, the image below uses a bar chart to visualize this information. The bar chart named 'Actual Spend Vs Planned Budget'. I add data label which the white number is the planned budget and the red number is the actual spend.

4. Here i try to highlight rows where overspend exceeds 20% of planned budget in 'Budget Status' column. Where i use Edit Formatting Rule. First calculate how much the expenditure exceeds the initial budget.
````excel
		=(Actual Spend - Planned Budget)/Planned Budget
 ````
  and then if the expenditure exceeds the initial budget more than 20% or 0.2, mark the text with red fill.

5. And for optional, add the data bar in 'Actual Spend' column. Those with the highest expenditure have the longest bar data

## Results Overview
1. There are 277 that are over budget, and 223 that are on budget.
2. - Sum of Planned Budget ($) =  2.756.656
   - Sum of Actual Spend =  3.181.620
   - The difference between the two is 424,964. And expenses exceed income, so it is clearly a loss.
3. The image graph shows that the HR and IT departments have many expenses.
4. 232 that are over budget by more than 20% of the planned budget.
